# Odd &amp; Even Number Classification with Assembly Programming

<p>
The program asks the user to input 5 numbers to classify whether the numbers are odd or even. 
The numbers so far tested in this program can only accept 0 up to 9. After classifying odd and even numbers in its system,
it will then proceed to display all of the odd and even numbers altogether. </br>

This program demonstrates the push and pop (stack) function in assembly. </br>

<b> Please take note to use the appropriate application (such as DosBOX) in running the application/program.</b>
In this case, the code was written in notepad and executed through DosBOX and TASM. </p>
